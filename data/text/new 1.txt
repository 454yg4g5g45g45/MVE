{blacksmith_egyptian_desc}
A blacksmith provides superior quality weaponry for any troops trained in the settlement. His skills in metal working are exceptional, far beyond those of ordinary smiths who make agricultural implements.\n\nHe is an important man in the community, as good weapons are always valued by the men who have to use them. A Blacksmith who can make a strong sword that won't break or bend in combat is a great asset to his people.

{smiths_workshop_egyptian_desc}
An armourer works closely with a blacksmith, and produces fine armour to match the smith's weaponry. His work is highly valued by military men - well-made armour can often mean the difference between life and death! When his skills are added to those of a blacksmith in producing weapons, the armourer ensures that any troops trained in this settlement will be equipped to a very high standard.

{port_egyptian_desc}
A port brings trade and wealth to a settlement, and allows the construction of simple ships. Access to the sea is vital for all long distance trade. The sea lanes are the true highways of the world, and carrying goods by ship is the only way to move them cheaply enough to make a profit. Indeed, it is usually cheaper and quicker to send a cargo halfway across the world by sea than to the next city in a cart!\n\nMilitarily, ports are important because they have the men and equipment needed to build a fleet.

{shipwright_egyptian_desc}
A shipwright can build the warships needed for a strong fleet, while the improved port facilities allow more goods to be landed at and forwarded from the settlement.\n\nAs a port grows wealth flows into the town, and all manner of goods become available to the people.\n\nMilitarily, the improvements in ship-building usually lead to better ship-handling and tactics.

A shipwright can build the warships needed for a strong fleet, while the improved port facilities allow more goods to be landed at and forwarded from the settlement.

{dockyard_egyptian_desc}
A Dockyard has the equipment and skilled craftsmen needed to construct the largest and most advanced warships afloat, while the port can speedily handle many merchant vessels.\n\nThe city's merchants can easily send their cargoes to any port in the world, adding greatly to the wealth of the city and in return exotic goods from all over the world pass through the docks.\n\nThe Dockyard can produce any warship required by the fleet, and even provide the crews of slave rowers required by these large and powerful ships.

{sewers_egyptian_desc}
Sewers efficiently wash away the filth and rubbish from a settlement, making the place cleaner. Indeed, one measure of civilization might be the distance between one's nose and the final resting place of one's bowel movements! Sewers therefore help civilization's forward march.

{sewers_egyptian_desc_short}
Sewers efficiently wash away the filth and rubbish from a settlement, making the place cleaner and therefore healthier for the people.

{baths_egyptian_desc}
Public baths play an important part in the social life of the town; they are a place to meet as much as somewhere to get clean. Baths are often among the most magnificent of public buildings, and include cunning heating systems and many slaves to look after the needs of the citizens.

{farms_egyptian}	Land Clearance

{farms_egyptian_desc}
An improvement on slash-and-burn farming around a settlement, land clearances allow a surplus of food and encourage population growth.\n\nSubsistence farming, where people can only just feed themselves and their families, does not free people to do anything more than scrabble for a living. However, if agriculture improves even marginally, there will be growth in a settlement.\n\nThis kind of farming can be upgraded as the settlement grows.

{farms+1_egyptian}	Communal Farming

{farms+1_egyptian_desc}
Once slash-and-burn agriculture has worn out the land, one response is for farming communities to organise, and work collectively. Communal farming produces a surplus through minor economies of scale: tools and resources are pooled, and everyone works as a team to gather the harvest. Individual failures are minimised by these methods, and the increased output adds to population growth.\n\nThis kind of farming can be upgraded as the settlement grows.

{farms+1_egyptian_desc_short}
Communal farming produces a surplus that goes to market and this always ends up in a settlement, encouraging growth. People won't stay where there isn't enough to eat!

{farms+2_egyptian}	Crop Rotation

{farms+2_egyptian_desc}
Crop rotation and basic land management techniques stop farms from becoming rapidly exhausted. By changing field usage every year and allowing land to lie fallow or be used as pasture, the goodness of the land is slowly restored. Crop yields and surpluses improve as a result, and the increased output adds to population growth. Slave labour also helps, as peasant farmers generally keep more produce for themselves.\n\nThis kind of farming can be upgraded as the settlement grows.

{farms+3_egyptian}	Irrigation

{farms+3_egyptian_desc}
Damming rivers and using waterwheels to raise water to fields is labour intensive, but the pay offs can be spectacular. In some parts of the world it's even possible to gather more than one harvest a year when irrigation is used. Overall, extensive irrigation systems improve all farm production, creating even larger surpluses that can be sent to support a growing urban population.\n\nThis kind of farming can be upgraded as the settlement grows.

{farms+4_egyptian}	Great Estates

{farms+4_egyptian_desc}
The farming skills learned in the Nile valley make Egyptian farmers second to none. They can improve any land in the world and make it highly productive. These farming techniques are widespread in Pharaoh's domains, thanks to his wisdom in appointing servants to run large estates. Slaves and peasants may do the back-breaking labour, but it is the Pharaoh and his trusted appointees who ensure that there are large food surpluses. These can be sent to the great cities of Pharaoh's realm to ensure growth and prosperity.

{roads_egyptian_desc}
These minor roads have been made usable by the military only where necessary, and for the most part they are ancient tracks worn into the landscape, created over generations.\n\nMilitary engineers improve these ancient ways a little with simple bridges, a stony roadbed in marshy spots and by cutting back vegetation. They are not ideal but are certainly better than nothing.\n\nIn addition, tolls can be collected at certain key crossings.

{roads_egyptian_desc_short}
Roads are vital to territorial defence, allowing armies to move to meet any threat.

{paved_roads_egyptian_desc}
These improved roads allow armies to assemble and then meet approaching enemies swiftly. Paved roads are built for military use first and foremost. They are carefully surveyed and constructed, often including cuttings and extensive causeways. They will not degenerate into muddy rivers in winter or dusty tracks in summer, no matter how hard the usage.\n\nWith these better conditions, tolls can be collected more efficiently and at more locations on the road.

{paved_roads_egyptian_desc_short}
These improved roads allow armies to assemble swiftly and then march great distances to meet approaching enemies.

{mines_egyptian_desc}
Mines are needed to exploit the natural wealth of a province, although the dangerous underground work costs the lives of many slaves.\n\nMost mines are not very deep, as they are dug by back-breaking labour and follow the richest seams of ore into hillsides (drift mining), rather than having vertical mine shafts.\n\nWhere gold and silver are to be found, mining is sure to be a priority of the land's overlords.

{mines+1_egyptian_desc}
These deeper Mines exploit the wealth of a region more efficiently, allowing seams of ore to be dug out even below the water table.\n\nIn addition to the miners, teams of slaves are used to lift water out of the workings using treadmill-powered waterwheels. Working in a mine like this is usually a deferred death sentence.\n\nThe wealth extracted by these mines is more than enough to make a handsome profit and pay for a constant influx of new slave labourers.

Wise Pharaoh sets watchers over his children so that no one should ever be troubled by wrong thinking or tempted into the disloyal foolishness of rebellion! Sometimes it is not enough to execute naysayers and the disloyal. Those who question the order of things under Pharaoh's beneficent guidance must be rooted out before they can cause others to become unhappy.\n\nThe Secret Police can be improved as the city grows in size.
